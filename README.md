This is a sample project for [Steamworks.NET](//github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) it is intended to show functionality, act as documentation, and to test the functionality of Steamworks.NET.
The idioms and usage patterns applied here may be flawed (such as the lack of proper error checking.) As such please learn from this project, but take care in implementing any aspects from it.
Check out the [Steamworks.NET Example](//github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-Example) project for a more realistic way of implementing Steamworks into your game.

This sample is available in the public domain (where acceptable.) Please view [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for more details.
